Design

- Typing is preferred over other actions
  - Example: When Shift and Ctrl fights for the same location Shift
    wins, because it is needed to type upper case letters.

- Every button should have an equivalent to the US ANSI layout

Differences to Miryoku

- Right Alt is not used
- On the base layer no home row mods
  - They were triggered involuntarily sometimes
- On Media and Nav layer one shot mods are used, which can be used
  with the base layer buttons
- The Media and Nav layer must be accessed by a single function key.
  One shot mods are not activated when typing fast(rolling) and when
  they are accessed via layer tap(which is a dual function key).
- The delete key is only on the Nav layer
- The ESC key is on the function layer. It remains in its original
  location and APP key is moved to the outer thumb key, and TAB is
  removed from the layer.
